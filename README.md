# TrashLink 🗑️⚙️

**TrashLink** is a modern, sensor-driven smart trash bin designed to simulate how intelligent waste sorting and monitoring can be seamlessly integrated into real-world sanitation infrastructure.

## 🧠 How It Works

TrashLink uses an intelligent combination of hardware sensors and locally deployed custom-trained large language models (LLMs) to autonomously categorize and sort trash. It brings automation, efficiency, and hygiene into waste management.

### ⚙️ System Simulation Features

- **Single Inlet Design**  
  All trash is disposed of through a single inlet onto a flat internal platform.

- **360° Smart Scanning**  
  High-precision cameras and sensors mounted around the plate capture data from all angles.

- **AI-Powered Categorization**  
  A locally deployed LLM analyzes the scanned waste in real-time and classifies it into:
  - **Biomedical Waste**
  - **General Waste**

- **Automated Sorting**  
  Based on classification:
  - The internal flat plate tilts to direct waste into the corresponding compartment.
  - Two separate internal containers hold the biomedical and general waste.

- **Fill-Level Detection**  
  Laser-based sensors measure the fill level of each compartment.

- **Fullness Alert**  
  When the bin is approximately **90% full**, a **red indicator light** turns on, signaling the need for cleaning or emptying.
